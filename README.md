# Lucky Dog
## Preparing the Application
You'll need to create a `.env` file in your lucky-dog project directory before you can start, and you'll need to add to it the following values:

```
REACT_APP_FETCH_API_URL = https://frontend-take-home-service.fetch.com
REACT_APP_FETCH_API_KEY = {PUT YOUR FETCH TAKE-HOME API KEY HERE}
REACT_APP_GEO_API_URL = https://api.opencagedata.com
REACT_APP_GEO_API_KEY = {PUT YOUR FREE OPENCAGE GEO API KEY HERE}
```

You should already have a REACT_APP_FETCH_API_KEY.
To get a REACT_APP_GEO_API_KEY, go to [https://opencagedata.com/](https://opencagedata.com/) and sign up for a free account. Once you have done that, you should be provided with a free key that will work for this project.

Once your `env` values are set up, you should be ready to launch.

## Launching the Application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the React frontend of the app.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
